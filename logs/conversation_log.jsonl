Regarding your question about the latest research on SGLT2 inhibitors for kidney disease, I have some information for you.\n\nSodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are a class of drugs that have been gaining attention in managing chronic kidney disease (CKD). These medications work by interfering with the reabsorption of glucose and sodium in the early proximal renal tubule, helping to remove excess glucose from your body through urine [Web].\n\nTwo landmark studies have demonstrated that SGLT2 inhibitors can improve adverse health outcomes, such as kidney failure, cardiovascular events, and mortality, among patients with CKD, regardless of the presence or absence of diabetes [Ref 13, 14]. This suggests that these drugs may be beneficial for individuals like yourself who have been diagnosed with Stage 1 CKD.\n\nIt is important to note that SGLT2 inhibitors should be temporarily discontinued during acute intercurrent illnesses, particularly when there is evidence of volume depletion [Ref 12]. This advice is often referred to as the \"sick day rules\" and can be found in many CKD management tools.\n\nI encourage you to discuss this information with your nephrologist at your next appointment, as they will be able to provide personalized recommendations based on your specific health situation.\n\nTake care,\nClinical AI Agent\n\n🌐 _This answer includes information retrieved via live web search._\n\n📚 **Web Info Used:**\n\nType 2 diabetes can lead to diabetic kidney disease, but a class of drugs that cause the kidneys to remove glucose through urine has been gaining attention. Abstract SGLT2 (sodium-glucose cotransporter 2) inhibitors interfere with the reabsorption of glucose and sodium in the early proximal renal tubule, but the magnitude and duration of any ensuing natriuretic or diuretic effect are the result of an interplay between the degree of upregulation of SGLT2 and sodium-hydrogen exchanger 3, the extent to which downstream compensatory tubular mechanisms ... The effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on cardiovascular and kidney outcomes are consistent regardless of the background use of GLP-1 receptor agonists. These findings suggest independent effects of these evidence-based therapies and support clinical practice guidelines recommending the use of these agents in combination to improve cardiovascular and kidney metabolic outcomes. Introduction We compared the kidney outcomes between patients with diabetic kidney disease (DKD) aged ≥75 years initiating sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors versus other glucose-lowering drugs, additionally presenting with or without proteinuria.Research design and methods Using the Japan Chronic Kidney Disease Database, we developed propensity scores, implementing a 1:1 ... Objectives: This study aimed to investigate the nephroprotective effect of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) in elderly patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and hypertension based on real-world clinical data.
